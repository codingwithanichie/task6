For Visa

/^4\d{12}(?:\d{3})?$/


- `^`: Asserts the start of the string.
- `4`: Matches the digit 4, which is the starting digit for Visa cards.
- `\d{12}`: Matches exactly 12 digits after the initial digit 4. Visa cards can have either 13 or 16 digits in total, so this accounts for the remaining 12 digits in a 13-digit Visa card number.
- `(?:\d{3})?`: This part `(?:\d{3})` matches exactly 3 digits, and the `?` at the end makes this group optional. This allows for the case of 16-digit Visa card numbers, where an additional 3 digits can be added after the initial 12.
- `$`: Asserts the end of the string.

So, this regular expression pattern checks if the card number starts with a 4, followed by either 12 or 15 digits (totaling 13 or 16 digits) which is typical for Visa card numbers
